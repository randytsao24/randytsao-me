This is my personal site (v2).

The site is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

#### Getting Started

1. `npm i`
2. Set up service account credentials (`service-account.json`) in the root directory.
3. `npm run dev`
